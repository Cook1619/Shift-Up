        <h3 class="title">What am I looking to get out of this program and why?</h3>
        <p>I'm looking to become a Full Stack Javascript developer because I like creating interactive webpages,
            problem solving, and design. I like working on both end of the projects and finally getting the data your
            looking for to display in the way you planned it. I'm also looking forward to the mentorship to learn
            different ways to solves problems and become a more efficient programmer.</p>
        <h3 class="title">Why would I be a good fit for this program?</h3>
        <p>Because having gone through a very immersive bootcamp already I know what it takes to get a whole lot of
            work done quick. I'm looking at taking a slower path this time to really master the concepts I need to
            break into this industry. I'm willing to help out anytime I'm able to, and I never give up on trying to
            learn new technologies.</p>
